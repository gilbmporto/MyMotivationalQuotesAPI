# MyMotivationalQuotesAPI
An Express Js based API server so anyone can access my favorite quotes from the most admirable persons all around the world.

To see it running, you'll have to download it and type 'node main.js' in your terminal. It'll be at your 4001 PORT. Make sure to have NodeJs installed in your PC. 

This API uses only the GET and POST http methods. You may even post any quote from any author you'd like to have stored. That's pretty much it. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‘Œ
